- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheAdmrial
- 👀 I’m interested in disc golf, snow skiing, boating, and otherwise adventuring in the outdoors. I am also interested in how the world works and the hidden relationships between things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. I am currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in Data Science. My current graduation date is July 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will help me to stretch and grow. My skill set is currently limited, but I am willing to learn and try new methods and ways of doing things. 
- 📫 How to reach me: 
      The best place for now is my email: adamromriell@gmail.com

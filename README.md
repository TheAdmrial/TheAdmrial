- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam!
- 👀 I’m interested in golf, snow skiing, boating, and otherwise adventuring in the outdoors. I am also interested in how the world works and the hidden relationships between things.
- 🌱 I currently spend most of my time with SQL at work, but I am familiar with R and the Tidyverse, Python and Pandas, Power BI, and Tableau. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Data Science with a minor in Accounting in July 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will help me to stretch and grow. My skill set is currently limited, but I am willing to learn and try new methods of doing things.

      The best place for now is my email: adamromriell@gmail.com
